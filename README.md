# Master Thesis

## Introduction
This software was developed as part of my master thesis. It shows different bones, muscles, tendons, cartillages and vessels of a human hand obtained from an MRI. It allows to rotate the hand and place the model somewhere in a room. It's specifically coded for Microsoft's HoloLens.
